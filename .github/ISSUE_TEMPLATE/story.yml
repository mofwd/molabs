        Example: Project managers are often in the field or in meetings with customers. When asked about project costs, they must return to their desk to access information, creating delays and appearing unprepared. This damages customer confidence and wastes PM time.

      description: What assumption are we testing with this story?
      placeholder: |
        We believe that providing PMs with mobile access to real-time project costs
        will result in faster customer responses and increased PM confidence.
        
        We'll know we're right when:
        - PMs respond to cost questions 80% faster
        - PM satisfaction with tools increases by 20%
        - 90% of PMs use mobile view at least weekly

        Scenario: PM views project costs on mobile device
          Given I am a project manager with active projects
          When I access the PM dashboard on my mobile device
          Then I see a list of my active projects
          And I can tap a project to view current costs
          And costs are updated within 5 minutes of actual changes
        
        Scenario: Cost data is accurate
          Given a project has recent cost updates
          When I view the project on mobile
          Then the displayed costs match desktop dashboard
          And the last update timestamp is shown
        
        Scenario: Works offline with cached data
          Given I previously viewed project costs
          When I lose internet connectivity
          Then I can still view cached cost data
          And a "last updated" warning is displayed
        ```
