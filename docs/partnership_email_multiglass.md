**TO:** Nasser Ahmed, [TITLE/POSITION], Multi-Glass

**SUBJECT:** Partnership Discussion - IMF & Multi-Glass US Manufacturing Collaboration

---

Dear [Nasser Ahmed's executive assistant or intermediary],

Thank you for the productive conversations we've had regarding a potential partnership between Multi-Glass and Insulation Materials Fabrication (IMF). As discussed, I'm reaching out to formalize our next steps and propose a meeting between Mr. Nasser Ahmed and Steve Castellarin, President of IMF, to explore how our organizations can work together.

## About M&O Holding Company & IMF

M&O Holding Company represents a family of integrated companies serving the commercial and industrial insulation market for over 50 years. Our portfolio includes:

- **M&O Insulation (Midwest & Atlantic)** - Commercial insulation installation across 30+ states
- **M&O Environmental (MOE)** - Environmental compliance and abatement services
- **Insulation Materials Fabrication (IMF)** - Our manufacturing facility in Mokena, Illinois (Greater Chicago area)

IMF is our manufacturing arm, producing custom fabricated metal components, insulation blankets and pads, fabricated fittings, and other specialized products for the commercial insulation industry. We supply both our own installation companies and external contractors throughout the United States.

## Why IMF is an Ideal US Partner for Multi-Glass

We believe IMF represents a uniquely qualified partner for Multi-Glass's entry into the US market:

**US Manufacturing Infrastructure Ready to Scale**  
Our Chicago-area facility is fully operational with the capacity, equipment, and expertise to integrate Multi-Glass raw materials into immediate production. We can begin manufacturing with your materials without the delays and capital investment required to establish new US operations.

**Established Market Presence & Credibility**  
With 50+ years in the commercial insulation industry, M&O brings instant market credibility and an established reputation that opens doors with major contractors, facility owners, and engineering firms across the United States.

**Vertical Integration = Guaranteed Demand**  
Unlike independent fabricators, we own our installation companies. This vertical integration provides stable, predictable demand for products manufactured using Multi-Glass materials. Our recent completion of a $100 million+ datacenter insulation project demonstrates our capacity for significant material consumption.

**Proven Volume Capacity**  
Our work on large-scale industrial projects—including datacenters, power plants, refineries, and commercial facilities—generates substantial and ongoing demand for quality insulation materials. We have the project pipeline and workforce to drive meaningful volume.

**Quality Standards & Union Workforce**  
Our 100% union workforce maintains the highest craftsmanship and quality standards, ensuring that products manufactured from Multi-Glass materials meet and exceed industry specifications.

## Proposed Meeting Agenda

We would like to propose a meeting between Mr. Ahmed and Mr. Castellarin to discuss:

1. **Introductions & Company Overview**
   - Multi-Glass capabilities, product specifications, and US market objectives
   - IMF manufacturing operations and current product lines
   - M&O Holding Company's market reach and project portfolio

2. **Partnership Framework**
   - Raw material supply relationship and product applications
   - Quality standards, certifications, and technical requirements
   - Volume projections and growth opportunities

3. **Operational Considerations**
   - Logistics, shipping, and supply chain coordination
   - Lead times and inventory management
   - Pricing framework and payment terms

4. **Timeline & Next Steps**
   - Partnership launch timeline
   - Pilot production phase considerations
   - Long-term collaboration goals

## Next Steps

We would be pleased to visit Multi-Glass at your facility at your earliest convenience. This would give us the opportunity to see your operations firsthand and discuss how we can work together to bring Multi-Glass products to the US market through IMF's manufacturing capabilities.

Please let us know your availability for a meeting with Mr. Ahmed, Steve Castellarin and myself. We're flexible on timing and happy to work around your schedule.

Thank you again for considering this partnership opportunity. We're excited about the potential to work together and believe this collaboration could be mutually beneficial as we both continue to grow our businesses.
