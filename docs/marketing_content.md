Every blanket is custom-fabricated to fit your exact specifications—because your equipment deserves a perfect fit, not a one-size-fits-all solution.


#### Firestopping

FIRE STOPPING
MAKE M&O PART OF YOUR FIRE PREVENTION PLAN

When seconds count, smart fire prevention makes all the difference. M&O’s fire stopping services create invisible barriers that can save lives—sealing the pathways that fire and smoke use to spread through your building and giving occupants precious time to escape safely.

STOP FIRE IN ITS TRACKS

Fire stopping is your building’s silent guardian. We strategically seal openings and gaps to prevent both lateral and vertical fire spread, containing flames to their origin point. Whether installed during construction or retrofitted to existing buildings, our passive fire protection systems work 24/7 without power, maintenance, or human intervention.

COMPLIANCE MADE SIMPLE

The 2005 NEC (Article 300.21) requires that electrical penetrations through fire-rated assemblies be properly fire stopped to maintain ratings. We ensure your building meets all code requirements while maximizing occupant safety.

HILTI ACCREDITED EXCELLENCE

We’re proud to be HILTI Accredited—an honor shared by only 120 companies nationwide. This elite certification gives us access to cutting-edge education, industry updates, and safety protocols that keep us at the forefront of fire stopping technology.

Your fire prevention plan isn’t complete without proper fire stopping. Let’s build your safety strategy together.


There are three elements of Fire Stopping:
Fire-rated walls, floors, partitions or ceilings that are being penetrated.
The object creating the penetration, such as cables, cable trays or conduits.
Methods and materials used in sealing penetrations to prevent the spread of smoke and fire.
Firestops create intelligent physical barriers that block flames, toxic smoke, and deadly gases from spreading through openings created during building upgrades or system installations. Whether it’s electrical, plumbing, communications, or ventilation work, we ensure every penetration becomes a fire-resistant seal that protects lives and property.

FIRE STOPPING PARTITIONS

Fire stopping joints between critical elements like compartment walls and floors maintains unbroken fire resistance throughout your building. Our fire partition walls strategically subdivide rooms and floors with vertical assemblies that extend seamlessly from floor to ceiling, creating compartmentalized safety zones.

SMOKE BARRIERS

Smoke barriers are specialized fire barriers designed to stop smoke’s deadly spread—both vertically and horizontally. We follow strict International Building Code (IBC) standards: barriers require minimum one-hour fire-resistance ratings, while partitions need at least 30-minute ratings. Every facility benefits from these protective systems, especially high-occupancy buildings and industries handling volatile materials where explosions and rapid fire spread pose serious threats.

From hospitals to manufacturing plants, our fire stopping technologies create the protective infrastructure that saves lives when every second counts.

### Environmental Services
#### Lead Abatement
LEAD ABATEMENT
The Lead Paint Legacy

For decades, lead was the coating of choice across industrial America. Its exceptional durability and corrosion resistance made it ideal for warehouses, power plants, bridges, and countless other structures that needed long-lasting protection. What seemed like an engineering triumph, however, concealed a serious health threat.

As these lead-based coatings aged and began to deteriorate, the true dangers became clear. Lead dust created during maintenance, renovation, or natural weathering poses severe health risks through inhalation. Even more concerning is lead poisoning, which occurs when the body absorbs lead particles over time. These health impacts can affect multiple organ systems and are particularly dangerous for children and pregnant women.

Federal Recognition and Response

In 1978, recognizing the mounting evidence of lead’s toxicity, the United States government banned the use of lead-based paints and coatings. This regulatory action marked a turning point, but it also created a new challenge: safely managing the millions of structures still containing these hazardous materials.

Our Systematic Approach to Lead Removal

Lead abatement demands more than standard removal techniques. It requires specialized equipment, comprehensive containment strategies, and meticulous planning to protect both our workers and the surrounding environment. Our certified team understands that every lead removal project involves potential exposure risks that must be carefully managed.

We begin each project with thorough assessment and planning, ensuring proper containment protocols are in place before any work begins. Our specialized equipment and trained personnel follow strict procedures designed to minimize dust generation and prevent environmental contamination.

Protecting Workers and Communities

Our commitment extends beyond simply removing lead-based materials. We prioritize the health and safety of our work crews through proper protective equipment and adherence to all safety protocols. Equally important, we implement comprehensive environmental protection measures to safeguard the surrounding area and community.

Every lead abatement project we undertake follows EPA guidelines and industry best practices, ensuring the work is completed safely and thoroughly. When the job is finished, you can be confident that the lead hazard has been properly eliminated without creating additional risks.

Certified expertise. Comprehensive safety. Complete peace of mind.

#### ASBESTOS ABATEMENT
Understanding the Asbestos Challenge

For nearly a century, asbestos was the construction industry’s miracle material. This naturally occurring mineral, harvested from the earth’s depths, seemed to offer everything builders desired: unmatched fire resistance, incredible durability, and versatile applications. From the thermal insulation wrapping your pipes to the tiles beneath your feet, from roofing materials overhead to the very drywall that defines your spaces – asbestos became woven into the fabric of our built environment.

But this mineral harbors a dangerous secret.

Why Professional Removal is Required

The six distinct types of asbestos fibers share one devastating characteristic: they’re all confirmed carcinogens. When disturbed, these microscopic fibers become airborne assassins, creating invisible health hazards that can affect both humans and animals for decades. What makes asbestos particularly treacherous is how easily it’s released during renovation, demolition, or even routine maintenance work.

This is why attempting asbestos removal without proper licensing isn’t just inadvisable – it’s potentially life-threatening. Both OSHA and the EPA recognize the severity of asbestos exposure, implementing strict regulations that govern every aspect of its handling and removal.

Our Abatement Process

Asbestos abatement is far more than simple removal – it’s a precisely orchestrated process of containment, control, and safe elimination. Our methodology encompasses three critical strategies: complete removal, secure encapsulation, and expert repair of asbestos-containing materials, all executed within controlled environments that prevent fiber release.

What sets us apart is our dual-certified supervisory team, cross-trained in both asbestos removal and re-insulation techniques. This unique expertise allows us to execute seamless “remove and replace” projects without the typical delays and coordination challenges that plague multi-contractor approaches.

Complete Project Management

Whether your project involves demolition of an aging structure, comprehensive renovation of a commercial space, or complete rebuilding from the ground up, our certified technicians provide reliable, single-source solutions. We handle everything from initial assessment through final clearance testing.

Our team manages the entire process so you don’t have to coordinate between multiple contractors. We remove the hazardous materials safely and efficiently, then help restore your space to meet your project goals.

Licensed professionals. Proven results. Your safety guaranteed.

#### Mold Remediation
Our expert team is experienced in mold damage removal, abatement, clean up, repair, remediation, and restoration. Commercial Mold Remediation Emergency services are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
